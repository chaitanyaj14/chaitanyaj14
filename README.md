# Hi there! 👋 I'm Chaitanya

I'm passionate about all things geospatial! From GIS to remote sensing, I love exploring the world through data. Here's a bit about what I do:

🛠️ Currently, I'm engrossed in developing new Python packages for geospatial, remote sensing, and machine learning applications.<br>
🌍 I'm always looking for new ways to apply geospatial technologies, so feel free to reach out if you have any interesting projects or ideas!<br>
🧠 I'm a machine & deep learning enthusiast. I'm fascinated by the potential of machine and deep learning in the geospatial domain. I've co-authored a paper on Deep Learning in remote sensing, which was published in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters!
