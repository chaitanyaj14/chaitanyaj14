# Hi there! 👋 I'm Chaitanya

I'm passionate about all things geospatial! From GIS to remote sensing, I love exploring the world through data. Here's a bit about what I do:

🛠️ Currently, I'm working on my Python skills, especially in the context of geospatial analysis.
🌍 I'm also diving into the world of geospatial programming, learning how to create interactive maps and spatial analyses.
💡 I'm always looking for new ways to apply geospatial technologies, so feel free to reach out if you have any interesting projects or ideas!

## 🧠 Machine & Deep Learning Enthusiast
I'm fascinated by the potential of machine and deep learning in the geospatial domain. I've co-authored a paper on Deep Learning in remote sensing, which was published in IEEE!
